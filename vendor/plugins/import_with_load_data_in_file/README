ImportWithLoadDataInFile
========================

This plugin allows you to bulk import records into a table using mysql's 'LOAD DATA INFILE' feature.
It is very similar to ar-extensions import feature, but it seems to be about 30% faster.

all it does is:
  - take a list of columns and a 2D Array with the column values
  - create a tempfile and put a csv representation of the data in it
  - call mysql's LOAD DATA INFILE against the temp file

Example
=======

# Table name: users
#
#  id         :integer(11)     not null, primary key
#  name       :string(20)     
#  surname    :string(32)      
# 
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # you need to include this module
  include ImportWithLoadDataInFile
end

cols = [:name, :surname]
vals = [["paolo", "dona"], ["james", "dean"]]
User.import_with_load_data_infile(cols, vals) # this generates a LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE statement

# if your db is on the same machine of the app server, you can switch off the LOCAL flag
User.import_with_load_data_infile(cols, vals, :local => false) # this generates LOAD DATA INFILE
