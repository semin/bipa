JOY 5.10
--------

1. (Optional) Modify the variable DEFAULT_PDBDIR in joy.h to
point to the directory where you store PDB files. The
program assumes that all the PDB files are in a single
directory with the file names pdb****.ent.

You can also set the environment variable JOY_PDBDIR to
overwrite the default assignment.

If you set this variable properly, you can simply type 'joy
1xyz' or 'joy 1xyza' to format the structure 1xyz (or chain
A of 1xyz).

2. Type './configure'

If you would like to install the programmes in '/somewhere/your_home/bin',
type './configure --prefix=/somewhere/your_home'.

If you would like to use cc rather than gcc on SGI,
type './configure CC=cc CFLAGS='-O2 -Xcpluscomm'.

3. Type 'make'. This will create a single binary 'joy'.

4. Type 'make install' to install the programme.

5. Before using JOY, you must download the package 'joy_related'
   and install it. JOY requires the programmes HBOND and SSTRUC.
